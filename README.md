Hi everyone! 
I hope everyone enjoys this updated version of the Hunger Games Simulator, now with new event texts as suggested by the EES family at Firbush, and with new event types 
- double kills, triple events and revive. Its all ready to go, just edit the start of the code to be your local working directory (and install the required packages). 

There is a new death toll each round, and a new stats each round which shows who has the most kills. These are both optional and you can just run without highlighting
those parts of the code if you prefer to just see the text. In general that is how the code works, it doesn't have a UI so you just have to run the parts in order ! 

Credit for the OG events must go to my friends Abbi, Pat Joe, Unnabh, Alisha, Eunan, myself and maybe more (lemme know if I missed
you out!)
The code was all me (and a bit of chatty and stack overflow assistance) 
Feel free to edit and improve my base stuff, it might have glitches as this is a newer and more ambitious verison. 
This simulator was based on an online one I used to play as a kid (mine is better tho XD)
